# Server-check-sistem

Monitoring was created to check servers IPs and warn if any connection is down. Combined with any tool that execute scripts, it can be run every minute or whatever fits better with the environment. Basically it works with 2 different DBs ("alerts" and "momento") which can be created by running the "config" and "config2" files.
